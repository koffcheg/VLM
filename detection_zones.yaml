# Configuration for detection zones used in the AI pipeline.
# Each item in the list represents a distinct zone that the system can monitor.
#
# A zone is defined by three properties:
#   - label: A unique name for the zone (e.g., "Head Zone").
#   - color: The BGR (Blue, Green, Red) color value painted on the mask image for this zone.
#            Format is [B, G, R] with values from 0 to 255.
#   - joint_ids: A list of keypoint IDs to check within this zone.
#
# The keypoint IDs from the YOLOv8-Pose model are as follows:
# 0: nose
# 1: left_eye
# 2: right_eye
# 3: left_ear
# 4: right_ear
# 5: left_shoulder
# 6: right_shoulder
# 7: left_elbow
# 8: right_elbow
# 9: left_wrist
# 10: right_wrist
# 11: left_hip
# 12: right_hip
# 13: left_knee
# 14: right_knee
# 15: left_ankle
# 16: right_ankle
